# WireGuard proof campaign 3

## Progress

[AGENT 2026-10-18] Work begins on `proofs/campaign-3` at `783510e8`, under
the [revised charter](2026-10-18-charter-proof-campaign-3.md). The inherited
proof tree includes campaign 1's GRO carry. No mirror definition or landed
proof has been changed. No new theorem or completed campaign outcome is
claimed at this checkpoint.

The first finding is **C3-F1: T6's actual-encryption prohibition remains
stronger than the mirror's admission checks**. The current charter's
retained-work clause still excludes a behavior already represented by R5's
coherent initialized replays. Both recipes reproduce on this branch. The
campaign stops at this classified finding. The proof gate and all twelve
counterexample recipes pass, as recorded below.

| Outcome | Status and remaining obligation |
| --- | --- |
| T1 nonce safety | Open. Existing staging certificates give bounded assigned nonces, but not initialized allocation uniqueness, non-reuse after failure, or the connection to every actual encryption. Its additional temporal prohibition after limit rejection needs the admission/queued-work distinction described below. |
| T2 transmit authorization and conservation | Open. R3 supplies initialized selection-time authorization; packet/material transport to actual encryption and socket emission, and complete TX dispositions, remain to prove. |
| T3 authenticated effects and silence | Open. R6 supplies the cookie gate's local contracts, not causal closure of all delayed effects. |
| T4 handshake replay resistance | Open. Source inventory and H1 interfaces identified; retained-peer timestamp histories and exchange-linked installation still need initialized execution closure. |
| T5 responder confirmation | Open. H1's local rotation and finite-history results do not discharge allocation-lifetime provenance, accepted-RX linkage, or every later encryption. |
| T6 key retirement | C3-F1 concerns the literal actual-encryption clause. Historical TX admission safety and RX attempt checks already have local R5 theorems; universal transport of those certificates and conditional cleanup remain open. |

## C3-F1: invalidation and clearing do not cancel previously admitted encryption

**Claim under examination.** Charter section 4, T6, lines 395–409 at
`783510e8`, prohibits transport encryption using an invalid or expired
sending key and extends that prohibition to retained work. Its introductory
reference to use checks supports a narrower, admission-time interpretation,
but the actual-encryption and retained-work sentences are stronger.

**Mirror-first diagnosis.** The checks occur in
`Leanux/WG/Send.lean:247–261`, before `createData` submits the batch.
`Leanux/WG/Data.lean:74–103` subsequently encrypts using the stored key's
bytes and the packet's assigned nonce, without checking validity, age or
the current sending counter. `keypairsClear` drops slot references and
removes index entries; a packet-held reference can preserve the object
until the TX worker releases it (`Keypair.lean:38–49,105–116` and
`Data.lean:221–249`).

The pristine C has the same boundaries: `send.c:356–388` checks at staging;
`send.c:162–219,287–309` encrypts later; `noise.c:112–177` retains material
until the last reference. Campaign 1's
[R5 report](2026-10-13-proof-campaign.md#r5--key-lifetime-enforcement-rule-zero-findings)
and [independent review](2026-10-13-review-r5-counterexamples.md) already
identify this distinction. The review's claim that Linux cannot realize
the delayed schedule was not adopted by the campaign report: kernel
scheduling reachability remains unestablished.

**Concrete existing recipes.** Both run the original initialized runner,
check its acceptance and equality with the observer, and inspect the
intervening native states in
`Leanux/Proofs/WG/KeyLifetime/ReplayDelayed.lean`. They use generated record
streams with coherent coarse clocks, jiffies and timer-arm records; they
are not Linux captures. The encrypted packet is a transport keepalive
with empty plaintext.

| Recipe | Relevant events and checked outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `r5-delayed-encryption` | Session material is derived at 132 seconds. Nonce 1 is staged at 311 seconds, before the 312-second deadline. At 322 seconds, a later staging attempt invalidates the same sending key. The earlier packet then produces its expected ciphertext before queued handshake work runs. |
| `r5-coherent-post-clear` | The later expiry check occurs at 679 seconds, after the zero timer's bucket becomes due at 678.832 seconds. The clear worker empties the slots and removes the index entry. One queued packet retains the same key allocation and then encrypts; transmission releases the packet and final key reference. |

Reproduction from the campaign worktree:

```sh
set -o pipefail
python3 -B docs/proof-campaign-replay.py r5-delayed-encryption |
  capped -- scripts/in-bundle lake env lean --run Leanux/Proofs/WG/KeyLifetime/ReplayDelayed.lean
python3 -B docs/proof-campaign-replay.py r5-coherent-post-clear |
  capped -- scripts/in-bundle lake env lean --run Leanux/Proofs/WG/KeyLifetime/ReplayDelayed.lean
```

**Classification and disposition.** This is a recurrence of an established
statement mismatch, not a newly discovered Linux security defect. It does
not establish a nonce collision, a bound violation in an encrypted nonce,
or a use after the allocation's final release. No upstream-tray entry is
warranted. The six security outcomes remain unfinished.

The supported contract records validity and age **at the original TX
admission**, retains that historical certificate with the queued packet,
and permits later encryption under its retained reference. RX enforces its
own checks at the decryption attempt. Retirement distinguishes stopping
new admission, unpublishing slots/index entries, and final store removal.
Those distinctions are needed even with a deterministic timer wheel.

This is a proposed clarification of the actual-encryption clause, not a
silent change to the charter. A worker-latency premise would restrict the
claim's domain and must be stated explicitly; it is not needed for the
historical admission contract. Adding a recheck to the mirror would alter
the C's control flow and is not an acceptable proof repair.

T1's section 4 sentence at lines 178–180 has a related source-level concern:
limit rejection blocks further admission, but does not cancel earlier
queued packets. The core nonce-safety goal does not require cancellation.
No initialized nonce-limit counterexample has been reproduced here, so this
is an outstanding wording concern, not a second established replay finding.

## Existing proof boundaries and follow-on work

The following are reused facts, not new campaign-3 results:

- `KeyLifetime.original_staging_admissions` establishes actual historical
  key/clock/allocation certificates and bounded submitted nonces, including
  prefixes before a later Stop. It does not transport those facts to every
  encryption or prove non-reuse of abandoned allocations.
- `KeyLifetime.original_receive_attempt_admission` establishes validity,
  the actual unexpired clock comparison and stored-counter bounds at the
  AEAD boundary, whether or not authentication succeeds. Its counter is
  distinct from the incoming wire nonce.
- `CryptokeyRouting.parsed_initialized_transmit_authorization` establishes
  the original selection-time authorization, not subsequent emission.
- Campaign 2 at `8874ccd6` has `Noise.original_slot_rotation`,
  `original_confirmation`, `original_begin_session_ordered`, and
  `original_session_allocation_refusal`. Its
  `original_interleaved_confirmation_history` is conditional on
  `FreshNextBound` in a finite native-operation language; it is not a
  whole initialized runner theorem or a failed-prefix confirmation theorem.
  None is imported from that unlanded branch here.

The next useful proof boundaries are a sending-key projection plus nonce
allocation events (including abandoned attempts), packet allocation and
consumption identity through the existing queue observers, and retained-peer
timestamp/exchange histories. The sending projection must not reuse the RX
window or receiving-key-material projection as if it described sending
state. Existing session receipts and actual receive-poll cuts provide the
starting points for confirmation; a slot invariant alone is insufficient.

The design reading adds three constraints to that follow-on work. AEAD coverage
must include `Env.cryptAhead` as well as ordinary encrypt activations, keeping
copied consistency trials separate from committed execution. B3's retirement
premise must use the actual wheel bucket and dispatch, with deletion and
replacement explicit, rather than a fixed delay bound. T3's cookie exception
bounds a reply per qualifying input; the rate limiter runs only after valid
MAC2, so it does not bound the rate of cookie replies.

Three read-only agents independently inspected the statement/source fit,
nonce architecture, and handshake/confirmation interfaces. Their shared
T6 observation is supported by the source references above; the replay is
the concrete check. No shared proof definition requires alteration for this
finding. Ranked mirror changes: none recommended; adding encryption-time
retirement guards would not preserve the mirror's altitude or C behavior.
An independent review of this documentation checkpoint found no actionable
issue after checking the mirror/replay boundaries, registered recipes,
campaign-2 theorem names and unchanged mirror pin. Its C assessment relied on
the earlier audits; the campaign's source inspection used the pinned pristine C.

## Validation

Both explicit coherent replays pass: original runner accepted, observer JSON
equal, lifetime 1 and nonce 1 retained, expected ciphertext emitted, and the
post-clear variant's final reference released. These are interpreter checks,
not kernel-proved universal statements.

The model build passes all 130 jobs. The unit suite passes 131 tests with one
skip: computing the selected kernel build's identity when no such build is
configured. These checks used:

```sh
capped -- scripts/in-bundle lake build leanux-model
capped -- scripts/in-bundle python3 -B -m unittest evaluator.test_evaluation evaluator.test_model_replay harness.test_trace harness.test_wg harness.test_linux
```

The inherited `LeanuxProofs` build passes all 973 jobs. The full proof gate
passes all 895 declarations over nine root modules, using only `propext`,
`Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`; its token, import and target checks pass.
The counterexample speedbump passes all twelve recipes, including both coherent
T6 witnesses and W7's full ring. These checks used:

```sh
capped -- scripts/in-bundle lake build LeanuxProofs
capped -- scripts/in-bundle scripts/proof-gate
capped -- scripts/in-bundle scripts/proof-counterexamples
```

The builds report the existing `Leanux/Env.lean:865` `String.mk` deprecation;
it belongs to the mirror lane and is not suppressed or changed here. The gate
also reports that its nested wrapper lookup cannot find `capped` inside the
bundle's PATH; the outer `capped` invocation still contains the gate and its
children in the capped cgroup. No differential check or guest was run.

The final diff contains only this report and the documentation index/register
updates. `git diff --check` passes, and `Leanux/` is byte-identical to `main`
at `783510e8`. The branch is preserved without merging or pushing.
