# Campaign 2: state-split retrofit

The retrofit starts from `04b2f7c` and incorporates main `b700659`. The
mirror is unchanged. The branch retains its proof tree, nondefault
`LeanuxProofs` target and `scripts/proof-gate`; main removed those pending
campaign 1's landing. No new result is attempted before this retrofit.

[USER 2026-10-16] Carry campaign 2 to the split worlds, retaining its
projection boundary. Remove frames only when the new types provide the
preservation fact. Follow campaign 1's native contracts and adapters where
the layers coincide; keep remaining local variants separate from claims.

## Baseline and accounting

The baseline census strips nested comments and strings and includes private
and attributed theorem declarations. Campaign 2 owns 427 Lean files,
1,831 theorems and 258 headline theorems at `04b2f7c`.

| Result | Files | Before theorems | Before headlines | Retrofit status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Common projection | 2 | 0 | 0 | Pending native and product observations |
| H1 Noise | 35 | 171 | 22 | Pending; release guards also changed |
| H2 Index | 68 | 318 | 52 | Pending native index-table and WG contracts |
| H3 Roaming | 35 | 119 | 13 | Pending native calls and product callbacks |
| H4 Configuration | 130 | 554 | 79 | Pending; routing and lifetime guards also changed |
| H5 Progress | 59 | 265 | 42 | Pending; ring representation and batch backlog fix also landed |
| H6 Timer discipline | 98 | 404 | 50 | Pending; timer wheel and worker queue semantics also changed |

Retyped, deleted and retained counts will be reported per validated tranche.
All six results remain lagging, with their previous charter gaps unchanged.
The last scoped validation at `04b2f7c` does not validate the split mirror.

## Migration boundaries

The design's sections 2–4 and 12–15 distinguish native `WG.M` executions
from product-level orchestration. The native observation projects `WGWorld`
and `Ambient` directly; product observations additionally retain the actual
fixture data when a claim needs it. No missing state is reconstructed with
defaults. Errors retain their actual stop and no invented final state.

Campaign 1's report at `5b0cbad` supplies the reference shapes: generic
StateT contracts, explicit nested native runs, generic component adapters,
and separate product observations. The campaign 2 result closure has no
direct imports of the old shared layers; those files remain campaign 1's
responsibility and are not edited here.

Deletion candidates include ambient-only preservation of the obsolete
Kernel and index-component preservation of peers. Return-value, totality,
exact-error and within-component facts remain substantive. Each deletion
will name the actual type and excluded state, separately from unused
support that becomes redundant.

The incoming mirror also contains behavior and representation changes since
`de62c9d`: queued-release guards, the receive ring, the batch pending-work
check, the FIB and timer wheel, and remaining-send-queue pending state. Those
are source carries, not type-given deletions. In particular, the former
`Env.fireTimer` interface is gone and the old local due-peer factor no longer
describes dispatch; their timer episode claims
need a bridge to the actual wheel dispatcher. The historical accepted
backlog finding stays attributed to its old mirror commit.

## Validation

Merge checkpoint only: no split proof build has passed yet. Retained gate:
`scripts/in-bundle scripts/proof-gate`. During the carry, build scoped modules,
print axioms for their logical declarations and replay the resulting closure
with `scripts/in-bundle lake env leanchecker --fresh MODULE`.
Only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound` are permitted. On the
shared host, all heavy commands run through `capped`, with the existing cap,
32 Lean threads and `LEANUX_QEMU_SLOTS=16`.
